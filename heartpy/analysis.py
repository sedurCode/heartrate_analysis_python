def calc_rr(peaklist, sample_rate, working_data={}):
    '''calculates peak-peak intervals

    Function that calculates the peak-peak data required for 
    further analysis. Stores results in the working_data{} dict.

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaklist : 1d list or array
        list or array containing detected peak positions

    sample_rate : int or float
        the sample rate with which the heart rate signal is collected

    working_data : dict
        dictionary object that contains all heartpy's working data (temp) objects.
        will be created if not passed to function

    Returns
    -------
    working_data : dict
        working_data dictionary object containing all of heartpy's temp objects

    Examples
    --------
    Let's assume we detected peaks at these positions in the signal:

    >>> peaklist = [200, 280, 405, 501, 615]
    
    It is then easy to call calc_rr to compute what we need:

    >>> wd = calc_rr(peaklist, sample_rate = 100.0)
    >>> wd['RR_list']
    array([ 800., 1250.,  960., 1140.])
    >>> wd['RR_diff']
    array([450., 290., 180.])
    >>> wd['RR_sqdiff']
    array([202500.,  84100.,  32400.])

    Note that the list of peak-peak intervals is of length len(peaks) - 1
    the length of the differences is of length len(peaks) - 2
    '''
    peaklist = np.array(peaklist) #cast numpy array to be sure or correct array type

    #delete first peak if within first 150ms (signal might start mid-beat after peak)
    if len(peaklist) > 0:
        if peaklist[0] <= ((sample_rate / 1000.0) * 150):
            peaklist = np.delete(peaklist, 0)
            working_data['peaklist'] = peaklist
            working_data['ybeat'] = np.delete(working_data['ybeat'], 0)

    rr_list = (np.diff(peaklist) / sample_rate) * 1000.0
    rr_diff = np.abs(np.diff(rr_list))
    rr_sqdiff = np.power(rr_diff, 2)
    working_data['RR_list'] = rr_list
    working_data['RR_diff'] = rr_diff
    working_data['RR_sqdiff'] = rr_sqdiff
    return working_data


def update_rr(working_data={}):
    '''updates differences between adjacent peak-peak distances
    
    Function that updates RR differences and RR squared differences 
    based on corrected RR list

    Parameters
    ----------
    working_data : dict
        dictionary object that contains all heartpy's working data (temp) objects
        will be created if not passed to function

    Returns
    -------
    out : dict
        working_data dictionary object containing all of heartpy's temp objects

    Examples
    --------
    Let's assume we detected peaks at these positions in the signal:
    
    >>> peaklist = [200, 280, 405, 410, 501, 615]
    
    And we subsequently ran further analysis:
    
    >>> wd = calc_rr(peaklist, sample_rate = 100.0)

    The peak at position 410 is likely an incorrect detection and 
    will be marked as such by other heartpy functions. This is indicated
    by an array 'binary_peaklist' in working_data. Binary peaklist is of
    the same length as peaklist, and is formatted as a mask:

    For now let's set it manually, normally this is done by the check_peaks()
    function from HeartPy's peakdetection module.
    
    >>> wd['binary_peaklist'] = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

    Rejected peaks are marked with a zero and accepted with a 1.

    By now running update_rr(), heartpy will update all associated measures
    and will only compute peak-peak intervals between two accepted peaks.

    >>> wd = update_rr(wd)

    This will have generated a corrected RR_list object in the dictionary:
    
    >>> wd['RR_list_cor']
    [800.0, 1250.0, 1140.0]

    As well as updated the lists RR_diff (differences between adjacent peak-peak intervals) and 
    RR_sqdiff (squared differences between adjacent peak-peak intervals).

    Parameters
    ----------

        list or array containing peak-peak intervals

    rr_diff : 1d list or array
        list or array containing differences between adjacent peak-peak intervals

    Returns
    -------
    working_data : dict
        dictionary object that contains all heartpy's working data (temp) objects.

    measures : dict
        dictionary object used by heartpy to store computed measures.

    Examples
    --------
    Normally this function is called during the process pipeline of HeartPy. It can
    of course also be used separately.

    Assuming we have the following peak-peak distances:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> rr_list = [1020.0, 990.0, 960.0, 1000.0, 1050.0, 1090.0, 990.0, 900.0, 900.0, 950.0, 1080.0]

    >>> rr_sqdiff = np.power(rr_diff, 2)
    >>> wd, m = calc_ts_measures(rr_list, rr_diff, rr_sqdiff)

    All output measures are then accessible from the measures object through
    their respective keys:

def calc_fd_measures(method='welch', square_spectrum=True, measures={}, working_data={}):
    '''calculates the frequency-domain measurements.

    Function that calculates the frequency-domain measurements for HeartPy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    method : str
        method used to compute the spectrogram of the heart rate.
        available methods: fft, periodogram, and welch
        default : welch

    square_spectrum : bool
        whether to square the power spectrum returned.
        default : true

    measures : dict
        dictionary object used by heartpy to store computed measures. Will be created
        if not passed to function.

    working_data : dict
        dictionary object that contains all heartpy's working data (temp) objects.
        will be created if not passed to function

    Returns
    -------
    working_data : dict
        dictionary object that contains all heartpy's working data (temp) objects.

    measures : dict
        dictionary object used by heartpy to store computed measures.

    Examples
    --------
    Normally this function is called during the process pipeline of HeartPy. It can
    of course also be used separately.

    Let's load an example and get a list of peak-peak intervals

    >>> import heartpy as hp
    >>> data, timer = hp.load_exampledata(1)
    >>> sample_rate = hp.get_samplerate_mstimer(timer)
    >>> wd, m = hp.process(data, sample_rate)
    
    wd now contains a list of peak-peak intervals that has been cleaned of
    outliers ('RR_list_cor'). Calling the function then is easy

    >>> wd, m = calc_fd_measures(method = 'periodogram', measures = m, working_data = wd)
    >>> print('%.3f' %m['lf/hf'])
    1.037

    Available methods are 'fft', 'welch' and 'periodogram'. To set another method, do:

    >>> print('%.3f' %m['lf/hf'])
    1.037

    warning is raised and frequency measures are returned as np.nan:
